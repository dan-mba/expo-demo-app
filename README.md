# Expo Demo App

This app is my attempt to duplicate much of my 
[portfolio page](https://dan-mba.github.io)
 as a React Native app.
<br/><br/>
This app is built using 
[Expo](https://expo.io)
 and requires the `expo-cli` to run.

---

### expo start

This command starts the Expo server which compiles the code and 
serves it to a device running the Expo app.
